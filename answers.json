  "title": "Troubleshooting stalled Cody search index updates",
  "answer": "If you encounter a situation where the 'Updating Cody search index...' process appears to hang indefinitely, it may not be directly related to Cody itself. One potential cause could be related to extension dependencies. In one user's experience, deactivating the Python extension led to this issue, and reactivating it resolved the problem. Therefore, it's advisable to check your extensions and ensure they are properly enabled."

  "answer": "When utilizing your own API key and model configuration with Cody and `cody.dev.models`, the requests are primarily routed directly to your designated provider. While some background processing may occur to gather context and transmit telemetry data, the core prompt and request are designed to be sent to your deployment. This architecture aims to ensure that sensitive data remains within your control, minimizing exposure to external systems."
